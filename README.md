## How to do a Middle-Section Punch
1. Starting Position

Begin with your hand in a tight fist, making sure that your thumb is not tucked inside the other fingers. Keep your fist resting on the side of your body, right above the hip, with the palm facing upwards. This will be your punching hand.

2. Preparing 

Keep your fist by the waist; now, take your free hand, tighten it into a fist and extend your arm out in front of you, with the fist in front of your stomach, keeping the elbow straight. This is your ready hand. You are now in ready position.

3. Executing

Pull your extended fist back to your waist quickly. Simultaneously, extend your punching hand out quickly. While extending your punching hand, make sure that you rotate your fist so that when your hand is fully extended, the palm is facing downwards. It is almost like a lever; one hand extends while the other pulls back into starting position. Here, check that your punching hand is right in front of your solar plexus (the soft area right under the middle bone of your ribs). 

## How to do a Low-Section Block
1. Starting Position

Start with both hands in a tight fist, similar to how they were in the starting position of a middle-section punch. Again, ensure that the palms are facing upward.

2. Preparing

For this first block, we will be blocking with the right hand. To prepare, take your left hand, extend the arm out, keep the elbow straight and your hand in a tight fist. Your left fist should be a few inches in front of your left thigh. Now, form a fist with your blocking hand (right hand). Put the right fist on your left shoulder with the pinky touching the shoulder. You are now in ready position.

3. Exectuting

The next two steps will occur simultaneously. Pull your left hand to your waist back to starting position quickly. Your right elbow will unbend quickly and you will stop when your fist is in front of your right thigh and a few inches away from it.
