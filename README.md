## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SharanyaUpadhyay/AP-CSP-actual-website/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SharanyaUpadhyay/AP-CSP-actual-website/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## How to do a Middle-Section Punch
1. Starting Position

Begin with your hand in a tight fist, making sure that your thumb is not tucked inside the other fingers. Keep your fist resting on the side of your body, right above the hip, with the palm facing upwards. This will be your punching hand.

2. Preparing 

Keep your fist by the waist; now, take your free hand, tighten it into a fist and extend your arm out in front of you, keeping the elbow straight. This is your ready hand You are now in ready position.

3. Executing

Pull your extended fist back to your waist quickly. Simultaneously, extend your punching hand out quickly. While extending your punching hand, make sure that you rotate your fist so that when your hand is fully extended, the palm is facing downwards. It is almost like a lever; one hand extends while the other pulls back into starting position. Here, check that your punching hand is right in front of your solar plexus (the soft area right under the middle bone of your ribs).
